## Dataset
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of 1,797 8x8 pixels handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. Below is a detailed description of the MNIST dataset available in the sklearn.datasets module:

- Images: Each image is a grayscale image of size 8x8 pixels, representing a single handwritten digit.
- Labels: Corresponding to each image, there is a label that indicates the digit (0-9) shown in the image.
