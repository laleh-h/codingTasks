# Data Science Bootcamp - Coding Tasks
Welcome to the repository for coding tasks from my Data Science Bootcamp. This repository contains various projects and exercises completed during the bootcamp, showcasing different aspects of data science, including data preprocessing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and more.


## Overview
This repository is a compilation of various coding tasks and projects undertaken during my Data Science Bootcamp. Each project is designed to tackle a specific problem using different data science techniques and methodologies. The repository serves as a portfolio of my work and learning progress in the field of data science.
