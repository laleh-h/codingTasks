## Predicting Insurance Costs Using Age: A Linear Regression Approach

### Description:

This project explores the impact of age on insurance costs through the application of simple linear regression. By analyzing a dataset containing age and corresponding insurance costs, the model aims to predict insurance expenses based solely on age. The results highlight how age influences insurance premiums, providing valuable insights for both consumers and insurance companies. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the relationship between age and insurance costs.
